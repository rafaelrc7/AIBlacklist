# AI Blacklist

Helps you by removing known "AI slop" content from your search results.

This blacklist focus on blocking AI *generated* content, while not affecting content *about* it or service providers.

## Usage

This project generates lists for [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/), [uBlacklist](https://ublacklist.github.io/docs) and DNS blockers such as [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) and [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html).

So you need at least one of those (or another compatible service) installed.

### Ublock Origin

You can import the list by clicking [HERE](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafaelrc7/AIBlacklist/master/lists/ubo.list.txt&title=AIBlacklist).

You can also import it manually by:

1. Opening the uBlock Origin Dashboard
1. Clicking on the "Filter lists" tab
1. Scrolling down to "Import..." and expanding the section
1. Pasting the list link in the text box (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafaelrc7/AIBlackList/master/lists/ubo.list.txt`)
