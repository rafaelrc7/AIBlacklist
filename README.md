# AI Blacklist

Helps you by removing known "AI slop" content from your search results. Focused on developer/technology content.

This blacklist focus on blocking AI *generated* content, while not affecting content *about* it or service providers.

## Usage

This project generates lists for [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/), [uBlacklist](https://ublacklist.github.io/docs) and DNS blockers such as [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) and [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html).

So you need at least one of those (or another compatible service) installed.

### Ublock Origin

You can import the list by clicking [HERE](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafaelrc7/AIBlacklist/master/lists/ubo.list.txt&title=AIBlacklist).

You can also import it manually by:

1. Opening the uBlock Origin Dashboard
1. Clicking on the "Filter lists" tab
1. Scrolling down to "Import..." and expanding the section
1. Pasting the list link in the text box (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafaelrc7/AIBlackList/master/lists/ubo.list.txt`)

## Scope

These lists do not aim to block any and all content related to AI, but "slop" content made to deceive the user into thinking that they are looking at human-written content. I also consider simple mirrors/machine translated content with no attribution and no added value as slop.

A common problem is when you are searching for something tech/programming related and a lot of the top results are low-quality "articles" generated by AI, usually containing lots of mistakes. Those sites are the main target of this project. However, for example, explicit service providers of AI services (be it image generation or chatbots), although I personally do not use them, will not be included.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome, feel free to open an issue to report problems or sites that you would like to see added to this lists.

You are also encouraged to fork, clone and add domains yourself by opening a PR, but I do ask for you to run the scripts:
```sh
make fix-sources # Will remove blank lines, duplicates and sort the domain list
make check # Check that everything is ok
make # Regenerate lists based on new domain
```
